## Night Writer

I'm working through Turing's [Night Writer](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer/index). Similar approach as to what I did with [futbol](https://github.com/josh-works/futbol) and [War and Peace](https://github.com/josh-works/war_and_peace/).

It _might_ be helpful to have worked through a bit of the above `Futbol` project, to get a feel for my goals/methodologies/goals/constraints.

Onward!
